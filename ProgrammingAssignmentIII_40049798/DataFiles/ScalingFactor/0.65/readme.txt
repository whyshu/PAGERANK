For this test case parametric values used are:
scaling factor=0.65
maximum iterations=20

Note:
For experiements to show the effect of the size of the input and the scaling factor on the convergence time, check for convergence with tolerance value=1.0e-6. If your graph is a large graph set maximum iterations to 100.
